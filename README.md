Hey Everyone!

Here is your assessment challenge!

// When the page loads, have a button on the DOM that says 'generate'. 
// Upon clicking on that button, append a new container onto the DOM. 

// That container should have two buttons, one that reads 'delete', the other that reads 'change'. 

// Additionally, there should be text that provides a number. The number should be the number of times the 'generate row' button has been clicked.

The delete button should delete JUST the container that the button is in.

// The change button should change the background-color of the container to red. 

The default or 'normal' state of the background-color should be yellow. 
Clicking the button a second time should change it back to yellow, 3rd time red, 4th time yellow, etc.
